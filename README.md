# odin-recipes
This is the first project i will be completing for The Odin Project
It is a website calles Odin Recipes

In this project i expect to have learned and used the following:

-Setting up a Git repository
-Cloning said Repo
-Create a new website
-Add text, links and Images
-Writing good commit messages
-Knowing when to commit.

At the end of the project i will be evaluating myself and adding any
other things i may have used/learned, i also will list anything i might have 
had difficulties with.
