    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <h2>Traditional Dutch dishes.</h2>

    <p>On my recipes page i have provided for you three, simple but staple
        recipes to traditional Dutch winter dishes.</p>

    <p>They may look simple, which they are, but each tastes amazing, despite
        having an almost identical order of preparation.</p>
    
    <p>All three of these are calculated for about two persons, multiply if needed.</p>

    <p>Take a look, have a cook and eat until full, <em>Dutch food is no bull.</em></p>
