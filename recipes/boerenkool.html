        <strong>Boerenkool</strong> is a traditional Dutch dish, which is typically enjoyed in
        the wintertime, i could write an entire article on it, but as many
        Dutch food is meant to be: No embellishment needed, cook and 
        let the dish speak for itself.

    <h3>So, how do we make it?</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Put the potatoes in a big pot, fill with water until potatoes are 
            just about submerged.
        </li>
        <li>
            Put the boerenkool on top and cook for about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            After 10 minutes add the rookworst on top, and let it sit on medium
            heat for 20 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take the pan off the stove and mash the potatoes and boerenkool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Take a skillet and bake the rashers until golden brown, add these to
            the mash.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, put the mash in a nice bowl, or leave in the big pot, put it
            all on the table, put the rookworst on top and enjoy!
