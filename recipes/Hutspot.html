    <p>
        <strong>Hutspot</strong> is another one of my favorites!
        Another no -nonsense Dutch dish meant to taste good and nourish
        the body and soul.
        Typically enjoyed in winter, but, as with any of my recipes, also fine
        to enjoy slightly smaller portions of year-round!
